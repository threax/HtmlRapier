<h1 data-hr-run="hello-world-demo">Hello World</h1>
<p>This is a really simple example of using a controller and a model to display some data on the screen.</p>
<div data-hr-controller="helloWorldDemo">
    <p data-hr-view="hello">Hello {{message}}</p>
    <p>So, that is pretty stupid, but it is actually doing something.</p>
</div>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<h3>The Markup</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The markup defines a controller named <em>helloWorldDemo</em> and a model named <em>hello</em>&nbsp;and model that we use
    to bind our data. The model will be a TextNodeModel which will fill in a variable called {{message}}.</p>
<h3>The Javascript</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In javascript we create a controller constructor function named HelloWorldController. This is then passed to controller.create
    along with the name of the controller elements we want to bind new instances of that controller object to.</p>
<p>Once the controller is being constructed we get our model from the bindings and set its message data with setData. This will
    go to the markup and replace any {{message}} variables with the value &quot;World&quot; from our data.</p>
