<h1>Fetcher</h1>
<p>HtmlRapier makes use of the fetch api to do http requests. You can use another back end if you wish (its all injected anyway), but the Fetcher class allows us to use fetch with the decorator pattern, which makes enhancing your requests with things like access tokens or cache busing query strings much easier and more centralizable than the functional fetch api does.</p>
<p>At its core Fetcher is just an abstract typescript class that has a fetch method matching the signature of the browser fetch method. You will likely always want to at least include a WindowFetch instance for your fetcher, since that calls the actual fetch funciton in the browser. In addition to this you can further decorate the fetcher with additional capabilities. Out of the box the library includes a way to deal with Open ID Connect access tokens and a way to get around cache issues using query strings. If you need additional capabilities you can implement your own Fetcher instances and chain them like the built in classes do.</p>
