<h1>HtmlRapier Quick Guide</h1>
<p>This guide shows some example usages of the HtmlRapier library. This library forms a good MVC foundation for&nbsp;modern web applications&nbsp;without going overboard.</p>

<h2>HtmlRapier Goals</h2>
<p>Instead of being just another javascript framework we try to think differently. For starters we don&#39;t even actually use javascript, but instead use typescript. These are the fundamental goals of the library and should help give you some insight into why things are done the way they are.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Total separation of html (view) and typescript (logic).</strong> This is the foundational requirement of this library. The current front-end trend is to combine these two together, however, we believe that the separation is good and the barriers this creates can actually help you write better code.</li>
	<li><strong>Do not create another programming language.</strong>&nbsp;Most similar libraries fail here by adding extensions into html even for something as simple as an if statement. While this does not seem like a problem on the surface we believe lots of people can understand html and some custom attributes that are always static. Add logic, even just if statements and those people can no longer work on your code. ALL logic should go into typescript, that is the programming language, your html is a data file.</li>
	<li><strong>Use standard html.</strong> All custom attributes in HtmlRapier are properly prefixed with data-. This way HtmlRapier code is fully html5 compliant and will validate without the need for additional tools. This also prevents your markup from being totally locked into a particular system. It also makes it easier to embed HtmlRapier into another application if desired, since you will always be html compliant and the data-hr-whatever attributes should be unique.</li>
	<li><strong>Do not recreate the browser in javascript.</strong> So many of these frameworks want to also let you make mobile apps, so they include things like routing and view management so you can build &quot;Single Page Applications.&quot; We believe that a browser written in c++ with a well defined, standardized api will always be superior to this, so we let the browser handle this lifecycle.&nbsp; HtmlRapier works on a concept of a &quot;View Program&quot; where a particular view may be a farily rich application (think a crud table that lets you search and update items without refreshing the page), but we are not trying to shove the entire thing into one page. If we have another crud table for some other piece of data, that will be its own html endpoint with its own request and browser load.</li>
	<li><strong>No experimental features.</strong> We could improve some of our code using experimental features in typescript like decorators, however, we won&#39;t use anything not committed to by its original authors as stable.</li>
	<li><strong>Strongly Typed.</strong> HtmlRapier is strongly typed using Typescript to write code. We believe this increases the maintainability of the code by having better tooling and a compiler able to check for certain classes of errors.</li>
	<li><strong>Flat node_modules structure encouraged.</strong> By default npm and node want to use the exact version of a particular library when running. HtmlRapier is designed to be used with yarn and to use yarn install --flat to install dependencies. The library should largely be backward compatible and if it won&#39;t be we reccomend to always create compiler errors so that any code using changed functions needs to be revisited when you can&#39;t compile. If your code is getting so big that you cannot manage this, its too big reduce it down.</li>
	<li><strong>Use dependency injection.</strong> All controllers are created with a dependency injector. This makes configuration easier and provides more flexibility for the code you write.</li>
